# Privacy Policy Setup for Chrome Web Store

You need a publicly accessible privacy policy URL for Chrome Web Store submission.

## Quick Steps

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

This will upload PRIVACY.md to your GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Use GitHub Raw URL (Immediate - Recommended)

Once pushed, use this URL in your Chrome Web Store submission:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduardoarantes/cycling_coach_browser_plugin/main/PRIVACY.md
```

**Test it**: Open that URL in your browser after pushing. It should show the privacy policy text.

## Alternative: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

2. Under "Source", select: **main** branch
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 3: Access Your Privacy Policy

After GitHub Pages is enabled, your privacy policy will be at:

```
https://eduardoarantes.github.io/cycling_coach_browser_plugin/PRIVACY.md
```

Or create a prettier version at:

```
https://eduardoarantes.github.io/cycling_coach_browser_plugin/privacy
